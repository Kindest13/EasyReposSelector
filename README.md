# EasyReposSelector
It's just a simple react app which uses git api search to log some data.
Be aware that github search api allows only 10 requests per minute for unauthenticated requests, for auth requests it allows up to 30 not so much, so to say, here I use unauthenticated requests. See also (https://developer.github.com/v3/search/)
